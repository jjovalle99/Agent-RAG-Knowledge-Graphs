This Checklist provides the criteria necessary to achieve the specialization as a consulting partner. AWS Partners undergo a technical validation of their capabilities upon applying for a specific specialization. AWS leverages\\n        in-house expertise and a third-party firm to facilitate the technical validation. AWS reserves the right to make changes to this document at any time and without notice.\\n\\n \\nExpectation of Parties\\nIt is expected that AWS Partners will review this document in detail before applying for the AWS Competency Program, even if all of the prerequisites are met.\\n        If items in this document are unclear and require further explanation, please contact your AWS Partner Development Representative (“PDR”)\\n        or AWS Partner Development Manager “', metadata={'source': 'https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/generative-ai/consulting/Cks9Pu3tv.html', 'title': 'AWS Partner Network -  Checklist', 'description': '', 'language': ''})),\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This approach combines retrieval from a database with generative AI to produce more accurate and relevant responses. It involves specifying the datastore used for search, the type of data (text, non-text), data preparation processes, mechanisms for ingesting, updating, and deleting data, chunking methods, embedding models, metadata, indexes, re-ranking methods, and the process to generate a response with the results retrieved from the datastore.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fine-tuning**: This involves customizing a pretrained model to better suit specific tasks or datasets through techniques like domain adaptation fine-tuning or instruction-based fine-tuning.
